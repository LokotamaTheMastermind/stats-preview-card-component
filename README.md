## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

### What I learned

```html
<!-- I learnt how to use row-cols-* -->
<!-- It's a class in bootstrap for sectioning columns and rows for smaller screns and devices -->
<!-- Example: -->

<div class="row-cols-1">
    <div class="col-6"></div>
    <div class="col-6"></div>
</div>

The above sets the column to be even on all devices but stay inside of 1 general row class and not overflow from it!
```

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - This helped me to get ideas for how to make responsive grids and how to make the color overlay for the image.
- [Bitflow created by me](https://bitflow.vercel.app) - This is what I used to get also an idea of how to mke an image have a color overlay
